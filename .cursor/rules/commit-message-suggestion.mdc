# Suggesting a Commit Message

When you make changes to the codebase or are provided with a git diff without additional context, you must suggest a comprehensive commit message that summarizes the changes.

**Formatting Guidelines:**

- **Placement**: Include the commit message at the end of your response, following any code edits.
- **Formatting**: Enclose the commit message within triple backticks to create a plain-text code block.
- **Structure**: The commit message should follow this format:
  
```text
<type>[optional scope, in parenthesis]: <description>

- optional body line 1
- optional body line 2
- optional body line n
```

**Structure Details:**
- **Type**: Choose from {feat, fix, chore, refactor}
- **Scope**: Scope should always be `(daw)` if the code changes were made within the directory `pia-applications/ui/apps/degree-audit-wizard/`, otherwise omitted.
